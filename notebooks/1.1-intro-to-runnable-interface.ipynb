    "What is an Event Loop?\n",
    "An event loop in programming, particularly in asynchronous programming, is a central control structure that manages and dispatches events or messages in a program. In the context of Python's asyncio library, the event loop is a core feature that runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks, handles network IO operations, and manages subprocesses. It is essentially the heart of the asyncio module, enabling asynchronous programming by juggling and scheduling the execution of various tasks.\n",
    "Key Concepts in the nest_asyncio Code\n",
    "Patching asyncio: The code modifies (patches) certain parts of the asyncio library. This is done to change the default behavior of asyncio, particularly to support nested event loops, which are not allowed in standard asyncio.\n",
    "Reentrancy in Event Loops: The primary function of nest_asyncio is to make the asyncio event loop reentrant. In computing, reentrancy refers to the ability of a function to be paused in the middle of execution and safely called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous executions are complete. This is not normally supported by the asyncio event loops, as they are designed to prevent re-entry (or nesting) to avoid complex problems and unexpected behavior.\n",
    "Modifying Loop Behavior: The code alters the behavior of the event loop methods like run_forever, run_until_complete, and the internal _run_once. These modifications allow the event loop to pause and resume (re-enter) gracefully, facilitating nesting.\n",
    "Context Managers: The code uses context managers (manage_run and manage_asyncgens) to properly manage the state of the event loop during entry and exit of asynchronous contexts, which is crucial for handling nested loops correctly.\n",
    "Task Patching: It also patches the Task class of asyncio to modify its step function. This is necessary to ensure that the tasks (units of work scheduled by the event loop) behave correctly in a nested loop scenario.\n",
    "Tornado Patching: If the Tornado library (an asynchronous networking library) is used, nest_asyncio makes Tornado aware of the Python asyncio Future, ensuring compatibility.\n",
    "Understanding the Event Loop in Async Programming\n",
    "In asynchronous programming, especially in Python's asyncio, the event loop is pivotal. It allows the execution of multiple tasks seemingly in parallel by switching between them. This switching is non-blocking, meaning the program can handle other tasks while waiting for some IO operation to complete, thereby increasing efficiency and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nest_asyncio library's primary role is to tweak the asyncio's event loop to support nested operation, which is particularly useful in scenarios like running an asyncio event loop inside another asyncio event loop, something that standard asyncio does not support by default.\n",

       "[\"URL: https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/\\n\\nSUMMARY: Tool calling in LangChain allows AI models to interact with external systems, such as databases or APIs, by using a structured input schema. It involves four key concepts:\\n\\n1. **Tool Creation**: Tools are created using the `@tool` decorator, which associates a function with its input schema.\\n2. **Tool Binding**: The created tool must be connected to a model that supports tool calling, allowing the model to understand the tool and its required input.\\n3. **Tool Calling**: The model can decide when to utilize a tool, ensuring its response matches the tool's input schema.\\n4. **Tool Execution**: The tool is executed with the arguments provided by the model.\\n\\nA typical workflow includes creating tools, binding them to a model, and invoking the model with user input, which may lead to tool calls. An example tool is a function that multiplies two integers.\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the model integrations that support tool calling and further conceptual guides provided by LangChain.\",\n",
       " 'URL: https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/function_calling/\\n\\nSUMMARY: Tool calling, also known as function calling, in LangChain allows a model to generate output that matches a user-defined schema by producing calls to tools or functions. The model creates arguments for these tools, but executing the tools is the user\\'s responsibility. Tool calls consist of a name, an arguments dictionary structured as `{argument_name: argument_value}`, and optionally an identifier.\\n\\nMany LLM providers support tool calling features, enabling models to handle requests that include tool schemas. LangChain provides built-in tools and allows users to define custom tools using decorators or Pydantic classes. For example, tools can be defined to perform operations like addition or multiplication.\\n\\nTo use tool calling, developers must bind tool schemas to a chat model via the `.bind_tools()` method. Models can choose to call tools or not, but some models support a `tool_choice` parameter that can enforce tool calls. For instance, setting `tool_choice=\"multiply\"` ensures the multiply tool is always called.\\n\\nWhen the model generates tool calls, they appear in the `.tool_calls` attribute of the model\\'s response. This can include valid tool calls or malformed calls, which are captured as `InvalidToolCall` instances.

       " 'URL: https://blog.langchain.dev/tool-calling-with-langchain/\\n\\nSUMMARY: Tool calling in LangChain refers to a new feature allowing large language models (LLMs) to interact with external data sources through standardized tool invocations. This functionality has been introduced via a new `tool_calls` attribute on the `AIMessage` class, enabling a consistent interface for accessing tool calls across various LLM providers.\\n\\nKey points about tool calling in LangChain:\\n\\n1. **Standardized Interface**: The `tool_calls` attribute simplifies the extraction of tool invocations, which were previously handled differently by various model APIs. This standardization facilitates switching between different LLM providers.\\n\\n2. **Providers with Tool Calling Support**: Several LLM providers have introduced native tool calling capabilities, including:\\n   - OpenAI (first released in November, with \"function calling\")\\n   - Gemini (December)\\n   - Mistral (February)\\n   - Fireworks (March)\\n   - Together (March)\\n   - Groq (April)\\n   - Cohere (April)\\n   - Anthropic (April)\\n\\n3. **Key Components**:\\n   - `ChatModel.bind_tools()`: This method allows developers to specify available tools for a model by passing tool definitions, which can include Pydantic classes, LangChain tools, and raw functions.\\n   - `AIMessage.tool_calls`: A standardized way to access tool invocations returned by the model, encapsulated as `ToolCall` objects.\\n   - `create_tool_calling_agent()`: A function to build agents that work with any tool-calling model, making it easy to create sophisticated applications.\\n\\n4. **Usage Example**: Developers can invoke models with bound tools, and the output will include the `tool_calls` attribute, which contains details about the invoked tools.\\n\\n5. **Agent Creation Across Models**: The ability to create agents using different LLMs (like Anthropic, OpenAI, and VertexAI) remains consistent, making the framework versatile.\\n\\n6. **Integration with LangGraph**: The new interface simplifies the construction of agents and flows in LangGraph, a LangChain extension for building complex interactions.\\n\\nFor full documentation and further details, developers are encouraged to refer to the tool-calling documentation provided by LangChain.',\n",
       " 'URL: https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/tool_calling/\\n\\nSUMMARY: Tool calling in LangChain allows a model to intelligently detect when one or more tools should be called and to respond with the appropriate inputs for those tools. This is achieved through structured output, such as JSON, which enhances the reliability of tool calls compared to generic text completions. The tool calling mechanism supports various providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Mistral, enabling a more generalized approach than the specific OpenAI tools agent.\\n\\nTo set up tool calling, developers need to initialize models that support this feature, set the necessary API keys, and create tools (e.g., web search tools). An agent is then created to handle the tool calling, which can invoke multiple tools until a query is resolved. \\n\\nFor example, in a demonstration, a tool for searching the web was created using the Tavily API. The agent was initialized with a prompt and executed to answer a question about LangChain, successfully retrieving relevant information.\\n\\nKey features of LangChain include:\\n- **Retrieval augmented generation**: Allows LLMs to access external data sources.\\n- **Analyzing structured data**: Tools for working with databases, APIs, and PDFs.\\n- **Building chatbots and agents**: Frameworks for conversational AI applications.\\n- **Composability**: Chaining different LLM capabilities in a modular way.\\n\\nLangChain is open-source, with an active community contributing to its development.',\n",
