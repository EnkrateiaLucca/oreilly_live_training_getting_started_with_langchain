## Technical Implementation Patterns

### Chain Composition Patterns
```python
# Basic Chain
chain = prompt | llm | output_parser

# Parallel Processing
parallel_chain = {
    "summary": summary_chain,
    "analysis": analysis_chain
} | synthesis_chain

# Conditional Routing
def route_based_on_input(input_data):
    if condition:
        return "path_a"
    return "path_b"
```

### RAG Implementation Pattern
```python
# Standard RAG Flow
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | output_parser
)
```

### Agent Pattern with Tools
```python
@tool
def custom_tool(input: str) -> str:
    """Tool description for LLM"""
    return process_input(input)

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
```
